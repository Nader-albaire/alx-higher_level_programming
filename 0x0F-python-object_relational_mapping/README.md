Python Object-Relational Mapping Project
Overview

This project is designed to integrate Python programming seamlessly with relational databases through Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) techniques. By leveraging tools like MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy modules, you'll learn to bridge the gap between code and databases efficiently.
Prerequisites

Ensure your MySQL server is running version 8.0 or higher. Refer to the provided instructions for installing MySQL 8.0 on Ubuntu 20.04.
Background

This project explores the synergy between Python and databases. Initially, MySQLdb is utilized for database connectivity and executing SQL queries. Subsequently, SQLAlchemy is introduced as an ORM, eliminating the need for direct SQL queries within Python code. This abstraction simplifies database interactions, focusing on Python objects rather than SQL intricacies.
