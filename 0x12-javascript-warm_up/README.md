Project Title: JavaScript Warm-up 

Project Overview:
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for both scripting and web front-end development. In this project, you will delve into JavaScript fundamentals through scripting tasks. By mastering the basics, you will pave the way for more advanced projects, such as integrating JavaScript and JQuery into dynamic web applications like AirBnB.

Key Components:

    Scripting Tasks: You will undertake scripting tasks to understand the core concepts of JavaScript. This includes working with variables, constants, data types, operators, control flow, functions, objects, arrays, and more.
    Learning Objectives: By the end of this project, you will grasp essential JavaScript concepts and be able to explain them without external assistance. These include understanding the differences between var, const, and let, utilizing various data types, employing control structures like if statements and loops, manipulating dictionaries, and more.
    Requirements: Adhering to specific project requirements is crucial. You will write your JavaScript code using allowed editors, ensure compliance with semistandard coding conventions, and create necessary documentation like README.md. Additionally, your code will be tested on an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS environment using Node.js.

Learning Objectives:

    Understand the versatility of JavaScript and its applications.
    Run JavaScript scripts and manipulate variables and constants.
    Differentiate between var, const, and let and utilize them effectively.
    Explore various data types available in JavaScript.
    Implement control flow structures like if statements and loops.
    Use functions effectively and understand their scope.
    Master arithmetic operators and manipulate dictionaries.
    Familiarize yourself with file import mechanisms in JavaScript.

Copyright and Plagiarism:

    Originality and individual effort are emphasized in this project. Plagiarism is strictly prohibited, and any violation will result in consequences, including removal from the program.

Technical Requirements:

    Utilize approved editors for coding tasks.
    Ensure all files are interpreted on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Node.js.
    Adhere to coding standards, including semistandard compliance and proper documentation.
    All files should be executable, and the length of your code will be evaluated.

Additional Information:

    Install Node.js 14 for the project environment.
    Install and utilize semistandard for coding standards compliance.
    A thorough understanding of JavaScript fundamentals is essential for successful completion of this project.
