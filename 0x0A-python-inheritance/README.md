This Python project explores class inheritance. It covers topics like defining classes with multiple base classes, overriding inherited methods and attributes, and differentiating between super- and sub-classes. Here's a breakdown of the tasks:

    Lookup: Returns available attributes and methods of an object.
    My List: Creates a class that inherits from list and includes a method to print the list in ascending sorted order.
    Exact Same Object: Checks if an object is an instance of a specified class.
    Same Class or Inherit From: Determines if an object is an instance or an inherited instance of a specified class.
    Only Subclass Of: Checks if an object is an inherited instance from a specified class.
    Geometry Module: Begins with an empty BaseGeometry class.
    Improve Geometry: Builds on BaseGeometry with methods and exceptions.
    Rectangle: Creates a Rectangle class that inherits from BaseGeometry.
    Full Rectangle: Enhances Rectangle with method implementations and a specific string format.
    Square #1: Builds a Square class inheriting from Rectangle.
    Square #2: Enhances Square with a specific string format.
    My Integer: Creates a class MyInt that alters the behavior of comparison operators.
    Can I?: Implements a function that adds a new attribute to an object if possible, raising exceptions when not feasible.
